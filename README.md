# Othello for Android

![Screenshot from the game](resources/screenshot.png)

This is a sample app for the [hurok UDF framework](https://github.com/atomgomba/hurok) and a fully playable Othello game. Playing against the computer and human vs. human games are both supported.

For a good example of how *hurok* is used, please have a look at the code for the [game history feature](https://github.com/atomgomba/othello/tree/main/feature/game-history); it's a bare-bones list of past game moves.

You can grab a ready-built APK from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/atomgomba/othello/actions).
